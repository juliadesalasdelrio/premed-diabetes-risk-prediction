# premed-diabetes-risk-prediction
Predictive and interpretable model for early prevention of Type 2 Diabetes, including a web-based decision support tool.

# PreMed – Early Diabetes Risk Prediction

## Project overview
PreMed is a predictive and interpretable machine learning system designed to
support early prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in non-clinical users.

The project combines:
- Predictive modeling
- Model interpretability
- Actionable health recommendations
- A web-based interface for decision support

## Motivation
Type 2 Diabetes represents a major public health and economic challenge.
Early detection and lifestyle-based prevention can significantly reduce
long-term healthcare costs and improve quality of life.

This project aims to make preventive risk awareness accessible, simple and actionable.

## Dataset
Publicly available health dataset including demographic, lifestyle and
clinical variables related to diabetes risk.

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Comparison of multiple predictive models
- Selection of final model based on performance and interpretability
- Generation of personalized recommendations based on key risk drivers

## Application
The final model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit,
allowing users to input personal health information and receive:
- Risk probability
- Risk level
- Key contributing factors
- Personalized preventive recommendations

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and preventive purposes only and does not
constitute a medical diagnosis.
